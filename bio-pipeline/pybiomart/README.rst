Introduction
-------------
With the wealth of biological data in the public domain, we need easy access to the resources. EBI has designed `biomart <http://www.biomart.org>`_, which enables retrieval of large amounts of data through simple interface. The `biomaRt <http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/2.2/bioc/html/biomaRt.html>`_ (R) and `biomart <http://github.com/dazoakley/biomart>`_ (ruby) allows programmers to get access to the data. The ``pybiomart`` packages aims to introduce some of the functionalities into python.
